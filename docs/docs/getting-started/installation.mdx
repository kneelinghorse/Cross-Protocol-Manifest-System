title: Install the Tooling
description: Install the CLI, protocol packages, and optional monorepo tooling for CPMS.
---

CPMS ships as a workspace of zero-dependency npm packages. You can consume them directly (recommended for app teams) or clone the repository to build from source.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** – Required for deterministic hashing and the built-in test runner.
- **pnpm 9.12+** – Use `corepack enable` so pnpm versions stay pinned.
- **Python 3.11+** – Needed only for CMOS orchestration scripts.

## Clone + Install

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/kneelinghorse/Cross-Protocol-Manifest-System.git cpms
cd cpms

# install workspace deps
eval "$(corepack enable pnpm)"
pnpm install
```

`pnpm install` bootstraps all protocol packages plus the docs site. Turborepo handles build orchestration.

## Consume as Packages

Add any subset of the protocols to an application via npm or pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @cpms/data @cpms/api @cpms/event --save-dev
```

Because every package is dependency-free, you can ship them directly into regulated environments without caring about transitive supply-chain risks.

## Optional Tooling

| Tool | Command | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- | ------- |
| `npm test` | `pnpm test` | Runs Node's test runner across repo protocols |
| `npm run benchmark` | `pnpm benchmark` | Enforces hash + diff latency targets |
| `npm run lint` | `pnpm lint` | Turborepo-powered ESLint |
| `npm run format` | `pnpm format` | Optional formatting helpers |

## CMOS Orchestration

If you operate missions with CMOS:

```bash
python3 cmos/scripts/mission_runtime.py status
python3 cmos/scripts/mission_runtime.py start --mission B4.4 --summary "Docs site" --agent "Codex"
python3 cmos/scripts/mission_runtime.py complete --mission B4.4 --summary "Docs deployed"
```

Always validate parity afterwards:

```bash
python3 cmos/scripts/validate_parity.py
```

## What Gets Installed

- Workspace packages under `packages/`
- Shared utilities under `internal/`
- Documentation site (Docusaurus v3) under `docs/`
- Mission orchestration assets under `cmos/`

With installation out of the way, jump into [creating your first manifest](./first-manifest).
