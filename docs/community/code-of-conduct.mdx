title: Code of Conduct
description: Expectations for contributors and maintainers.
---

We follow a lightweight, enforceable code of conduct aligned with the Contributor Covenant.

## Principles

- Be respectful—assume good intent, disagree constructively.
- No discrimination or harassment of any kind.
- Keep security disclosures private until patched.
- Respect privacy of mission data and telemetry logs.

## Reporting

- Open a confidential CMOS mission tagged `blocked` with details.
- Email `security@cross-protocol.org` for urgent issues.
- Provide logs, commit hashes, and reproduction steps when possible.

## Enforcement

- First offense: reminder + coaching.
- Repeated offenses: temporary loss of commit privileges.
- Severe misconduct: removal from the org and revocation of access tokens.

The project thrives when everyone feels safe to collaborate—help us keep it that way.
