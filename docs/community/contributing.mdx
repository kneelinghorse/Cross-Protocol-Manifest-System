description: How to propose changes, run tests, and follow mission workflows.

## Workflow

1. Open a CMOS mission or pick one marked `Current`/`In Progress` via `./cmos/cli.py mission status`.
2. Read both `agents.md` files (root + `cmos/agents.md`).
3. Run pre-flight checks:
   - `./cmos/cli.py validate health`
   - `./cmos/cli.py db show current`
4. Create a branch, implement changes, and keep zero-dependency guarantees intact.
5. Run `pnpm test` + targeted benchmarks when protocol code changes.
6. Update docs (this site) when new APIs or workflows ship.

## Coding Standards

- Pure functions, immutable updates, no shared global state.
- Extensive inline JSDoc for public helpers.
- OWASP Top 10 compliance: no eval, escape untrusted input, prefer whitelist validation.
- Mission telemetry: log start/complete via CMOS scripts—never edit YAML mirrors manually.

## Pull Requests

Include:

- Mission ID in the title.
- Summary of changes + verification steps (tests, benchmarks, docs build).
- Any telemetry or parity validation outputs in the PR body.

## Communication

- Primary: CMOS missions + MASTER_CONTEXT updates.
- Secondary: GitHub Discussions for roadmap items.
- Emergency: `cmos/telemetry/events/*.jsonl` for debugging state drift.
