# Mission: B4.7 Community Setup & Launch Preparation
# Sprint: Sprint 4 - Phase 4/5 Release & Ecosystem

missionId: "B4.7_community-setup"
version: "1.0.0"

objective: |
  Setup community infrastructure for open-source project including contributor guidelines, code of conduct, issue templates, and communication channels.
  Prepare for public launch with proper documentation, governance, and support processes.
  Create welcoming environment for external contributors.

context: |
  With technical implementation complete (packages published, docs live, examples available), final step is community infrastructure.
  
  Community setup includes:
  - CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines
  - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md establishing community standards
  - GitHub issue templates for bugs, features, questions
  - Pull request template
  - Community health files (.github directory)
  - Support channels (Discord, Discussions, or similar)
  - Roadmap visibility
  - Release notes process
  - Maintainer documentation
  
  This prepares project for external contributors and users.

# Cross-Protocol Manifest System v0.4.0 - Public Release 🎉

We're excited to announce the first public release of the Cross-Protocol Manifest System!

## What is it?

A declarative framework for defining and validating data schemas, APIs, events, and AI agents as version-controlled manifests. Think of it as "infrastructure as code" for your application contracts.

## Key Features

- 🚀 **Zero dependencies** - Each protocol runs standalone
- 📦 **npm packages** - Install only what you need
- 🔄 **GitOps-enabled** - Version-controlled manifests
- 🤖 **Auto-generation** - SDKs, tests, migrations from manifests
- 🔗 **URN linking** - Cross-protocol references
- ✅ **GitHub Action** - CI/CD integration

## Quick Start

\`\`\`bash
npm install @proto/data
\`\`\`

\`\`\`javascript
import { createDataProtocol } from '@proto/data';

const protocol = createDataProtocol({
  dataset: { name: 'users' },
  schema: {
    fields: {
      id: { type: 'string', required: true },
      email: { type: 'string', pii: true }
    }
  }
});

const validation = protocol.validate();
\`\`\`
