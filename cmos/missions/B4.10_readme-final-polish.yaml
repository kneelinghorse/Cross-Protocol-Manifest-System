# Mission: B4.10 README Final Polish & v1 Readiness
# Sprint: Sprint 4 - Phase 4/5 Release & Ecosystem

missionId: "B4.10_readme-final-polish"
version: "1.0.0"

objective: |
  Update main README and package READMEs with accurate installation instructions, live documentation URLs, and clear value proposition.
  Ensure repository is well-organized and immediately useful to developers discovering the project.
  Final polish for v1 public release.

context: |
  With packages published to npm (B4.8) and documentation deployed (B4.9), README needs updates to:
  - Show actual npm install commands (not clone-only)
  - Link to live documentation site
  - Update badges to show published package versions
  - Clean up outdated information
  - Make quick start actually quick
  - Show immediate value to developers
  
  Current README references Sprint 2/3 status - needs v1 framing.
  
  Philosophy: This is a free tool for developers. README should be clear, practical, welcoming.
  Skip community noise - focus on "what is it, why use it, how to install, where to learn more."

# Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Main README Update (45 minutes)

### 1.1 Update Header Section
```markdown
# Cross-Protocol Manifest System

**Version:** 0.4.0  
**Status:** Public Release

A declarative protocol framework for datasets, APIs, events, and AI agents.
Define contracts as version-controlled manifests, generate SDKs and migrations automatically.
**Zero external dependencies.**

## 📦 Installation

npm install @cpms/data

Or install specific protocols:

npm install @cpms/core     # Foundation utilities
npm install @cpms/api      # API Protocol
npm install @cpms/event    # Event Protocol
npm install @cpms/agent    # Agent Protocol
npm install @cpms/semantic # Semantic Protocol
npm install @cpms/catalog  # Catalog system
npm install @cpms/cli      # Command-line tools

## 📚 Documentation

**[View Documentation](https://[your-site-url])** ← Live docs with guides and playground

## 🚀 Quick Start (2 minutes)

# Install
npm install @cpms/data

# Create a manifest
cat > user-schema.json << 'EOF'
{
  "dataset": { "name": "users", "lifecycle": { "status": "active" } },
  "schema": {
    "fields": {
      "id": { "type": "string", "required": true },
      "email": { "type": "string", "pii": true }
    }
  }
}
EOF

# Validate it
npx @cpms/cli validate user-schema.json

# See what changed
# (edit manifest, then)
npx @cpms/cli diff user-schema-v1.json user-schema-v2.json
```

### 1.2 Core Philosophy Section
```markdown
## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**The manifest is the source of truth. Everything else is derived.**

- **Declare, don't write:** Manifests describe contracts; tools generate code
- **Zero dependencies:** Each protocol runs standalone
- **Immutable:** Updates return new instances
- **GitOps-ready:** Version control your contracts
```

### 1.3 Features Section
```markdown
## ✨ What You Get

- **Data Protocol:** Database schemas with PII detection and migration generation
- **API Protocol:** OpenAPI-compatible with SDK generation
- **Event Protocol:** Kafka/AsyncAPI schemas with 22M+ events/sec performance
- **Agent Protocol:** AI agent capability manifests with URN linking
- **Semantic Protocol:** Auto-enrichment with intent and criticality scoring
- **CLI Tools:** validate, diff, generate, query, graph commands
- **Catalog System:** Cross-protocol analysis and relationship detection

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Detect breaking API changes in CI/CD
- Generate TypeScript clients from API manifests
- Track PII data lineage across services
- Validate Kafka event schemas
- Document AI agent capabilities
- Detect incompatibilities before deployment
```

### 1.4 Architecture Section (Simplified)
```markdown
## 🏗️ Architecture

Five protocols, one foundation:

- **Data Protocol** - Database schemas, PII governance
- **API Protocol** - REST/GraphQL endpoints
- **Event Protocol** - Pub/sub events
- **Agent Protocol** - AI capabilities
- **Semantic Protocol** - Intent analysis

All built on shared utilities (hashing, validation, diff, query).
All immutable. All zero-dependency.
```

### 1.5 Development Section
```markdown
## 🛠️ Development

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/kneelinghorse/Cross-Protocol-Manifest-System.git
cd Cross-Protocol-Manifest-System

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Build packages
pnpm build

# Run examples
node examples/01-data-validation.js
```

### 1.6 Remove Sprint References
Delete or update:
- "Sprint 2 Complete, Sprint 3 In Progress" → "v0.4.0 Public Release"
- Sprint completion tables → simplified
- CMOS references (internal tooling, not relevant to users)

### 1.7 Add License and Links
```markdown
## 📝 License

MIT License - free to use anywhere

## 🔗 Links

- [Documentation](https://[site-url])
- [npm Packages](https://www.npmjs.com/org/proto)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/Cross-Protocol-Manifest-System)
- [Issues](https://github.com/kneelinghorse/Cross-Protocol-Manifest-System/issues)
```

## Phase 2: Package READMEs (30 minutes)

### 2.1 Template for Each Package
Each package in `packages/*/README.md` should have:

```markdown
# @cpms/[name]

[One-line description]

## Installation

npm install @cpms/[name]

## Quick Example

[Simple code example showing core functionality]

## Features

- [Key feature 1]
- [Key feature 2]
- [Key feature 3]

## Documentation

Full documentation: https://[site-url]/docs/protocols/[name]-protocol

## License

MIT
```

### 2.2 Update Each Package README
- packages/core/README.md
- packages/data/README.md
- packages/event/README.md
- packages/api/README.md
- packages/agent/README.md
- packages/semantic/README.md
- packages/catalog/README.md
- packages/cli/README.md

Each with specific examples for that protocol

## Phase 3: Repository Organization (20 minutes)

### 3.1 Verify LICENSE File
```bash
# Check LICENSE exists
ls -la LICENSE

# If not, create MIT LICENSE
```

### 3.2 Clean Up Root Directory
Remove or organize:
- Old protocol files if they're now in packages/ (keep for backward compat or delete)
- Temporary test files
- Build artifacts

### 3.3 Update .gitignore
Ensure ignored:
- node_modules
- dist/ (but packages/*/dist should be committed)
- .DS_Store
- *.log

### 3.4 Verify Repository Structure
```
Cross-Protocol-Manifest-System/
├── README.md           ✓ Updated
├── LICENSE             ✓ Present
├── packages/           ✓ 8 packages
├── docs/               ✓ Documentation site
├── examples/           ✓ Runnable examples
├── .github/workflows/  ✓ CI/CD
└── cmos/               (Internal - not user-facing)
```

## Phase 4: Final Polish (15 minutes)

### 4.1 Test User Journey
Simulate new developer:
1. Find repo on GitHub
2. Read README
3. Follow installation
4. Run quick start
5. Visit docs site

Ensure each step is smooth

### 4.2 Check GitHub Repository Settings
- Description: Clear one-liner
- Website: Link to docs site
- Topics: manifest, protocol, validation, api-schema, etc.
- About section complete

### 4.3 Social Preview
Check how repo looks when shared:
- GitHub generates preview from README
- Ensure first few lines are compelling
